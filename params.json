{"name":"QtMEL","tagline":"Qt Media Encoding Library","body":"### Welcome to the QtMEL project website.\r\n**QtMEL** is a [Qt](http://qt-project.org/) library that wraps [Libav](http://libav.org/), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and [RtAudio](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/) libraries and allows you easily grab your desktop screen, your cameras, your audio input devices and finally encode audio/video streams.\r\n\r\n### Project description\r\n**Platform:** currently only Windows (Linux version is partially done)<br>\r\n**License:** LGPL<br>\r\n**Current version:** 1.0 Alpha<br>\r\n**Issue tracker:** [Here](https://github.com/kibsoft/QtMEL/issues)\r\n\r\n### Key features\r\n* desktop screen capture with variable frame rate\r\n* web-cameras capture with variable frame rate\r\n* changing the image source on the fly (screen<->camera) while recording a video\r\n* audio input devices capture\r\n* video encoding with variable and fixed frame rate\r\n* audio encoding\r\n\r\n### Dependencies to build the project\r\n1. **Libav** - [Here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77719957/QtMEL_FFmpeg.zip) is a [git-14d94a1](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/source/ffmpeg/ffmpeg-git-14d94a1.tar.bz2) version (**QtMEL** is tested only with this version). It contains _inlude_ and _lib_ folders.\r\n2. **OpenCV** - Download [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.5/OpenCV-2.4.5.exe/download).\r\n3. **QtMultimediaKit** - Download [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77719957/QtMultimediaKit.zip). There are includes and dlls that were build using Qt 4.7.4/MinGW.\r\n4. **RtAudio** - you don't need to download anything it is in **QtMEL**.\r\n\r\n### Ready to use builds\r\nJust download [this](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77719957/QtMEL_Library.zip) archive and you will be able to use the **QtMEL** library in your projects!\r\nAll you need is to modify your .pro file like this:<br>\r\n```\r\n#add QtMEL library\r\nINCLUDEPATH += QTMEL_INCLUDE_PATH //just replace this with the actual path\r\nLIBS += -LQTMEL_LIB_PATH //just replace this with the actual path\r\n\r\nCONFIG(debug, debug|release) {\r\n    LIBS += -lqtmeld1\r\n} else {\r\n    LIBS += -lqtmel1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you must to include the headers this way:\r\n```\r\n#include <AudioGrabber>\r\n#include <CameraGrabber>\r\n#include <ScreenGrabber>\r\n#include <Recorder>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy coding!\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nIn order to understand how to use the classes provided by **QtMEL** you can look at the [examples](https://github.com/kibsoft/QtMEL/tree/master/examples) folder in sources.\r\n\r\n1. **EncoderExample** - it is the first example that allows you to capture your desktop screen(or parts of it) and record the streams(video/audio) to a file. Also this example contains the code that generates 500 frames and then encodes them to a video using fixed frame rate.\r\n2. **CameraExample** - this example allows you to capture your web-cameras (with audio).\r\n\r\nYou can download these examples [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/77719957/QtMEL_Examples.zip)(compiled).\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\nI want to thank **Daniel Roggen** for his [QtFFmpegWrapper](https://code.google.com/p/qtffmpegwrapper/)! \r\nIt became the starting point for my **QtMEL** project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
